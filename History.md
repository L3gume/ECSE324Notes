# Lecture 2

## Brief history of comp technology

First computing machines were completely mechanical: 1822 Difference engine, calculates polynomials using numerical difference methods.

* Working version in 1991

### Vacuum Tubes

Acts like an amplifier or a switch, if you have very fast and small switch, you can implement efficient logic gates.  

### First Generation

* Vacuum tubes enabled this
* much faster
* Programming was done at the machine level in assembly (machine language)

Stored-program computers were a revolutionary concept and the basis for today's computers.  
Programs and data are stored in the same memory.

### Transistors (1948, Bell Labs)

Brought second generation of computer with compilers and Fortran and punchcards and all the fun stuff

### Third Generation

* Integrated circuits
* Many of todays ideas first appeared
    * Parallelism
    * Pipelining
    * Cache and virtual memory
* Operating systems

### Fourth generation

* CPU on a single chip
* Intel 4004 (1971)
    * 1000 logic gates
    * 92000 instructions/sec

#### VLSI era (1980's) very large scale integration

Motorola 68000

* Major architectural step in microprocessors
    * 16/32 bit arch
* First impl in 1979
    * 68000 transistors
    * 1 mil instr/sec
* Used in:
    * Apple Macintosh
    * Sun, silicon Graphics  & Apollo workstations

### Modern Processors

Intel core i7 Processor

* 4 identical copies of a processor (cores) on the same substrate
* 128-bit datapath and 64-bit bus

Apple A9

* Used in iPhone 6/6s
* Dual core ARMv8-A
* Memory (Cache) on chip
* 6-core Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
